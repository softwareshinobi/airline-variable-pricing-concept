This repository showcases a concept airline price tracker website built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It demonstrates a playful approach to simulating dynamic flight pricing that increases with visitor count.

**Features:**

* Displays "live" pricing for flights to Cancun departing tomorrow.
* Utilizes a Bootstrap modal to present the simulated pricing and a call to action.
* Employs a "scarcity tactic" with a price increase alert based on visitor count.

**Code Structure:**

* `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the website structure and Bootstrap integration.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript code that manages the price simulation logic using cookies and DOM manipulation.

**Running the Application:**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser (locally or via a web server).

**Functionality:**

* Clicking the "See Latest CUN Flight Pricing" button displays the modal with a simulated price.
* With each page visit (modal open/close cycle), the price increases slightly, mimicking airline pricing strategies.

**Disclaimer:**

This code is for demonstration purposes only and does not reflect actual airline pricing practices.

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap)
* JavaScript
* Cookies.js (optional, for persistence)

**Potential Enhancements:**

* Implement a more realistic pricing algorithm.
* Integrate with an actual flight search API for real-time pricing.
* Add features like date range selection, number of passengers, etc.
* Style the website further using custom CSS.

**Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from this code!**
